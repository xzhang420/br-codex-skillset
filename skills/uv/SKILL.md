# uv (Python Package Manager)

`uv` is a fast Python package manager used by Science Skills to run their Python
CLI scripts. Many skills depend on `uv` being installed and on
PATH.

Ensure `uv` is available before running any skill that depends on it.

## Setup

1.  Check if `uv` is already available: `uv --version` (or `& uv --version` in
    PowerShell). If this succeeds, `uv` is ready — skip the remaining steps.
2.  Check whether `uv` is installed at its default location but not on PATH:

    -   **Unix/macOS**: `"$HOME/.local/bin/uv" --version`
    -   **Windows (PowerShell)**: `& "$HOME\.local\bin\uv.exe" --version`

    If either succeeds, skip to step 4.

3.  If uv is not installed do these steps in order:


    (a) Tell the user that uv is a tool for creating a consistent and reliable
        Python environment used for running the Science Skills, and that you
        need to install it now.

    (b) Install `uv`:

        -   **Unix/macOS**: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
        -   **Windows (PowerShell)**: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c
            "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`



4.  Add `uv` to PATH and verify (run as a single command):

    -   **Unix/macOS**: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" && uv --version`
    -   **Windows (PowerShell)**: `$env:PATH = "$HOME\.local\bin;" + $env:PATH;
        uv --version`

After setup, bare `uv` commands should work without repeating the export.
